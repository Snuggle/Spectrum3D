    Version : Spectrum3d-2.6.0 :
    * general changes : Display was distorted due to the inclusion of the SDL window in the GTK window; so Spectrum3d uses now only SDL in a separate window, like it used to be until version 2.1. Migration to SDL2 has been made, but it can still be compiled against SDL1.

    * general changes : functions allowing to enable realtime without Jack (including files tespool.c and testpool.h) have been removed since it was of no use and was the source of crash;
    * main : "stop" button has been removed; "Microphone" is now the default audio source;
    * onclick.c : bug that made crash Spectrumd3d when changing the perspective has been solved (in function "change_perspective");
    * gstreamer.c : bug that made encoded files (such as .mp3 or .flac files) not readable after porting from Gstreamer-0.10 to Gstreamer-1.0 has been solved;

    Version : Spectrum3d-2.4.0 :
    * gstreamer.c : spectrum3d can now be compiled against gstreamer-1.0 or gstreamer-0.10;
    * record.c and typesource.c : length of a audio file depending on its recorded (a timer is run when recording) or preexisting origin (a pipeline is created and its length is measured); there was a bug with this in Spectrum3d-2.4.0;

    Version : Spectrum3d-2.3.0 :

    * record.c and typesource.c : length of a audio file (either recorded or preexisting) is measured more simply; there was a bug with this on Ubuntu 12.10;
    * main.c : main window icon has been created;
    * geis.c : libutouch-geis has been renamed as libgeis; only the version 2 can be used, but it seems broken due to a bug in libgeis regarding gesture recognition;

    Version : Spectrum3d-2.1.2 :
    * main.c and display.c : SDL is used by defaut and hack a gtk window : either a window in the same window as the GUI, or a separate window; GtlGlExt can be used instead with the same result;
    * main.c and equalizer.c : equalizer window is constructed at the time of constructing the main window and not showed; pressing the 'equalizer' button will just show/hide it;
    * menu.c : test sound window cannot be duplicated anymore;

    Version : Spectrum3d-2.1.0 :
    * general changes : Spectrum3d can now be compiled against gtk2 or gtk3;
    * general changes : Spectrum3d can now use GtkGlExt instead of Sdl for OpenGL support (Sdl is still available since GtkGlExt for Gtk3 is not yet released at the time of release of this version of Spectrum3d);
    * display.c : display loop will now pass 1000 times instead of much more as it was the case; 
    * main.c and typesource.c : the relief of the source buttons have been changed since the background color cannot always be changed in Gtk3 by default on my system;

    Version : Spectrum3d-2.0.0 :
    * general changes : sound file can now be preloaded (ie analysed and displayed) before beeing played, or can still be analysed and displayed while playing (as it was already before); also sound can be recorded and loaded as an audio_file; the sdl-gl window can now be resized at any size on the fly;
    * main.c : SDL window is now built at the start of Spectrum3d and destroyed when Spectrum3d quits, as well as callback for managing events in sdl window and callback to display harmonics; SDL window can now be resized on the fly at any size;
    * main.c : many changes regarding the Gtk user interface : some buttons have been added, some were changed, some were removed and several have been moved to menu;
    * display : display_spectro() and display_paused_spectro() have been merged in one function;
    * gstreamer.c : in playFromSource(), the different parts have been merged in one part; 
    * typesource.c : created to manage the type of audio source, including the selection of an audio file and its preloading;
    * events.c : events are managed with SDL_PollEvent only; resize and scroll events have been added; key events have been changed somehow;

    Version : Spectrum3d-1.1.0 :
    * display.c : in the 'flat view', the graph is drawed using the GL_QUAD_STRIP instead of a lot of GL_QUADS; this saves a lot of CPU; 
    * display.c : the 'flat view' can be now be viewed at any width if the window, instead of of only 1200 pixels;
    * display.c : a new type of view is introduced : the 3D flat view, that is a kind of compromise between the 3D view and the strict 2D 'flat' view;
    * preferences.c : preferences file 'spretrum3d.pref' had been replaced by a 'spectrum3drc' file; preferences values are now listed in arrays at the top of the prefernences.c file and can be used, checked and handled in a more automatic way;
    * menu.c : clicking OK after just changes the values but doesn't open the preferences file anymore; on the other way, every preferences are written in the spectrum3drc file when the Spectrum3d is closed;
    * equalizer.c : fix a bug with band-pass/band-reject filter (filter couldn't be changed without be set off then on in again);
    * mainwindow.c : 'name' property of the 'jackaudiosrc' element set to "spectrum3d" instead of the default name ("jackaudiosrc0");

    * display : added a 'pointer' that can be set precisely; the corresponding frequency is then showed;
    * display : added another type of view : the 'flat view' : 2D view in which the intensity of the frequencies are in differents levels of red;
    * display : in the 3D view, frequencies are now drawed as 'LINES_STRIPS' and not 'QUADS' anymore;
    * equalizer.c : new file : set up an equalizer and band-pass/band-reject filter;
