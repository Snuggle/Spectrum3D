    Version : Spectrum3d-1.1.1 :
    * mainwindow.c : some code regarding jack have been put between #ifdef/#endif;
    * configure.ac : --disable-jack and --disable-geis that were not working have been fixed thanks to Valentino Dell'Aica's help;
    * src/Makefile.am : config.h has been removed from 'spectrum3d_SOURCES' since it is already created from config.h.in in configure.ac;

    Version : Spectrum3d-1.1.0 :
    * display.c : in the 'flat view', the graph is drawed using the GL_QUAD_STRIP instead of a lot of GL_QUADS; this saves a lot of CPU; 
    * display.c : the 'flat view' can be now be viewed at any width if the window, instead of of only 1200 pixels;
    * display.c : a new type of view is introduced : the 3D flat view, that is a kind of compromise between the 3D view and the strict 2D 'flat' view;
    * preferences.c : preferences file 'spretrum3d.pref' had been replaced by a 'spectrum3drc' file; preferences values are now listed in arrays at the top of the prefernences.c file and can be used, checked and handled in a more automatic way;
    * menu.c : clicking OK after just changes the values but doesn't open the preferences file anymore; on the other way, every preferences are written in the spectrum3drc file when the Spectrum3d is closed;
    * equalizer.c : fix a bug with band-pass/band-reject filter (filter couldn't be changed without be set off then on in again);
    * mainwindow.c : 'name' property of the 'jackaudiosrc' element set to "spectrum3d" instead of the default name ("jackaudiosrc0");

    * display : added another type of view : the 'flat view' : 2D view in which the intensity of the frequencies are in differents levels of red;
    * display : in the 3D view, frequencies are now drawed as 'LINES_STRIPS' and not 'QUADS' anymore;
    * equalizer.c : new file : set up an equalizer and band-pass/band-reject filter;
    * scale.c (drawPointer and drawPointerText): draw the pointer and its corresponding numerical values;
