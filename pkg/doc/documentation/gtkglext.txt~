SPECTRUM3D : GTKGLEXT SUPPORT

GTKGLEXT1, used with GTK2, has been released since years and is in the repositories of the main Linux distributions. GTKGLEXT3, necessary for usage with GTK3, is in development.

INSTALLATION of GTKGLEXT development version

The developpment version can be found on GtkGlExt web site and should be downloaded via git.
GtkGLExt's GNOME Git repository can be checked out anonymously:

	$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/gtkglext

Since it is a developpment version, it should be installed this way :

1) install dependencies : 
	- 'libgtk-3.0-dev';
	- gtk documentation package : in Ubuntu, the 'libgtk-3-doc' package is not enough : you have to install the 'gtk-doc-tools' package; 

2) go to the directory where the source of gtkglext are :
	
	$ cd ~/gtkglext-<version>

3) since we are working on the Git version, we can use bootstrap for generating configure script and Makefiles.

	$ env ACLOCAL_FLAGS='-I /pkgconfig/share/aclocal -I /gtk/share/aclocal' ./bootstrap --prefix=${HOME}/gtkglext --enable-debug=yes

Do not use 'autogen.sh' as it is recommended in the README since this has been changed and the README has not been updated.

4) then type :

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install 

GtkGlExt-3.0 should then be installed in /usr/local/include.
