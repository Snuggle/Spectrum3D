SPECTRUM 3D: 3D AUDIO SPECTRUM ANALYSER IN REAL TIME

Spectrum 3D displays a 3D audio spectrogram in real time; the source can be either the microphone or an audio file; it is also possible to record a file and to have it analysed; so analysis can be done done on the fly (harmonics are displayed while the audio file is being played), or before the file is being played (in that case, the analysis of the whole will be performed and displayed, then the file can be played afterwards). It is compatible with jack (jack-audio-connection-kit). Optionally, it supports multitouch gestures from touchscreen and touchpad. Optionally also, the audio stream can be run in realtime even if Jack is not used. It is build with the Gstreamer, SDL (or Gtkglext), OpenGl, GTK+-2.0 and uTouch-Geis free libraries and is under GPL license. It is written for Ubuntu but works for other Linux distributions except for the multitouch capabilities (the uTouch library is written for Ubuntu). 

Spectrum3d can be compiled against GTK2 or GTK3. It can use either SDL or GTKGLEXT libraries as OpenGL extension. For this, SDL is used by default. GTKGLEXT is a more logical choice but GTKGLEXT for GTK3 is still in development; it will probably the default when a stable version is released. However, GTKGLEXT can be used already in Spectrum3d, including the development version (GTKGLEXT3 for GTK3), but this has to be specifically enabled at the time of compiling.

*******************
|  INSTALLATION:  |
*******************

1. dependencies:
""""""""""""""""
FOR UBUNTU from 10.10 : All dependencies are available in the Ubuntu repositories.

		- gcc, pkg-config, automake;
		- libgtk-2.0-dev or libgtk-3.0-dev;
		- libgstreamer0.10-dev or libgstreamer1.0-dev;
	For DISPLAY (OpenGL extension): SDL is used by default; GtkGlExt can be used instead and its version should match the GTK version (GTKGLEXT1 for GTK2, GTKGLEXT3 for GTK3); however, GTKGLEXT3 is still in development; the development version should be installed then (see later); the display of harmonics itself will look exactly the same regardless of the library that is used. 
		- EITHER : lidsdl1.2-dev; this should be the default choice;
		- OR : libgtkglext1-dev for Gtk2 or libgtkglext for Gtk3 (this version is in developpment and should be compiled from source (see documentation) but is already supported in Spectrum3d); note that GtkGlExt version should match Gtk version;


		- gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad, gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse, gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly et gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse (for reading files such as mp3);

	For JACK support : 
		- (optional) libjack-dev (for jack1) or libjack-jackd2-dev for jack2; note that you don't need to have the 'jackd' package installed, but only the '-dev' library;

	For multitouch support (touchscreen and also for multitouch touchpad from Natty):
		- (optional) libutouch-geis-dev version 2 untill Ubuntu 12.04; this has been renamed libgeis-dev from Ubuntu 12.10;
		  NOTE : For Ubuntu 11.04, the repositories version will work, but filtering on number of touches won't work (Bug#769859 in libutouch-geis); to solve this you need a version of uTouch-geis that is at least 2.1.0; you can have it either by installing the '.deb' packages from Oneiric repositories (type in a terminal 'sudo apt-get build-dep libutouch-geis-dev', then install 'libutouch-geis1' first, then 'libutouch-geis-dev'), or by compiling the latest version from source (https://launchpad.net/utouch-geis); if you compile from sources, you can type in a terminal 'sudo apt-get build-dep libutouch-geis-dev' to have all dependencies installed. For Ubuntu 10.10, do not use the repositories version; use one of the previous solutions. 

FOR OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS : 
	For the other distributions, the dependencies should be very similar. Only the multitouch features maybe won't work since uTouch-Geis has been build for Ubuntu. However, the uTouch Suite (including uTouch-Geis) starts beeing ported in other distributions such as Gentoo (https://sabotageandi.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/utouch-gentoo/) or Fedora. More info on this in the documentation directory.

2. compilation and installation : 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
 	1) in a terminal, go to the directory where the sources are; for example, if the source package is in the HOME directory :

		$ cd ~/spectrum3d-<the-actual-version> (if the sources are in the "home" directory);

	2) type : 

		$ ./configure 

	IMPORTANT NOTE for GTK VERSION :
	Both GTK2 and GTK3 are supported; if GTK3 is installed, it will be used by default but you can override this by forcing the use of GTK2 by typing :

		$ ./configure --enable-gtk2 

	or 

		$ ./configure --disable-gtk3

	NOTE for DISPLAY (OpenGL extension):
	SDL is used by default and a error message will be delivered if it is not found. However you can choose to use GTKGLEXT library instead of SDL (GTKGLEXT for GTK2, GTKGLEXT3 for GTK3). Since the GTKGLEXT3 version (appropriate for GTK3) is still in development, use of GTKGLEXT is not yet the default choice and this has to be specifically enabled at the time of compilation. However the GTKGLEXT3 version (for GTK3) is already supported in Spectrum3d (see documentation or www.spectrum3d.sourceforge.net to install it). The display itself will look exactly the same regardless of the library that is used.
	If you want GTKGLEXT to be used instead of SDL, type:

		$ ./configure --enable-gtkglext

	NOTE for JACK and MULTITOUCH SUPPORT:
	If Jack library is found, JACK support will be enabled. Also, if libbamf and libutouch-geis version 2 libraries are found, MULTITOUCH support will be enabled. If those libraries are not installed, JACK and MULTITOUCH support won't be enabled. However, if you have those libraries installed but don't want those features enabled, you have to type '--disable-jack' or '--disable-geis' after 'configure' ('--enable-jack=no' and '--enable-geis=no' also works).
	For example :	

		$ ./configure --disable-jack --disable-geis

will deactivate JACK and MULTITOUCH support if those libraries are installed.

	You can combine many arguments. For example :

		$ ./configure --disable-gtk3 --enable-gtkglext --disable-jack

	If you want Spectrum3d to be installed in another directory than the default one ('/usr/local/bin'), you can add it at 'configure' step according to the 'Autoconf' standards. For example : 

		$ ./configure --prefix=/usr

will install the executable 'spectrum3d' file in '/usr/bin' directory instead of '/usr/local/bin'. 

	3) type :

		$ make

	4) type : 

		$ sudo make install (the password will be necessary for this)

	5) to completely remove Spectrum3d, type :

		$ sudo make uninstall


*********
|  USE  |
*********

Type in a terminal : 

	$ spectrum3d

or run it from 'Menu->Applications->Sound & Video->Spectrum3d'

The 2 most important things to do first are :
			- to select the type of audio source : either microphone or audio file;
			- set if analyse will be done in real time or not : if 'analyze in real time' is checked, harmonics will be retrieved and displayed on the fly, while the sound is being played; if 'Analyse in real time' is unchecked, harmonics of the whole audio file will be retrieved and displayed first, then the file can be played afterwards. When source is set to microphone and 'Analyse in real time' is unchecked, recording can be made; it will be analysed and displayed like for an audio file; similarly it can be also played afterward. 

Selection of multiple audio files is not possible anymore. The 'reload' button allows to reload (i.e. analyse and display its harmonics) without reselecting the file.

You can record from the microphone and have the generated audio file analysed and displayed by selecting 'microphone' as the audio source, then unchecking the 'analyse in real-time' button; then the record button will be usable; a 'record window' will then pop up; after recording, a click on 'OK' will load the file as for an audio file. 

If 'Use JACK' is checked, everything explained above can be done with Jack (Jack-Audio-Connection-Kit).

A new window that commands different filters can be displayed :
- a 10 bands equalizer; the filtered frequencies and their range can be adjusted; the amplification goes from -72dB to +36dB;
- a band-reject or band-pass filter;

The lowest displayed frequency is 0 Hz by default, and it can be increased. The default range is 2000 Hz. It can be decreased to 40 Hz or raised to 20000Hz. To change this, you can either change it by using the 'Range of Display' scale, or increase it by changing the factor that is on its right : this factor multiplies the frequency range. The smallest possible step between 2 analyzed and displayed frequencies is 2 Hz.

From the menu : 
	* you can choose between 3 types of view :  - a 3D view that shows frequency, intensity and time; It is possible to rotate or translate the display along the X, Y and Z axis, either by keyboard commands, or by mouse (+/- keyboard) commands, or by touch gestures (if enabled). All the analyzed values are kept in memory, which implies that even if zoom or perspective changes, any value can be retrieved at any time, even when playing is paused.
					   - a 2D 'flat' view : that shows time versus frequency; the intensity however is represented by the amount of red color;
					   - a 3D 'flat' view that is somehow a compromise between the two previous views.

	* the perspective can be reset, set to a 'front' view (frequency versus intensity), or set to values preset by the user. The text can be displayed or not, as well as the line scale. A 'pointer' can be displayed, showing a location on the scale and its exact numerical value as well as the intensity of the frequency (fot the 3D view).

	* you can chose to display text and lines or not and also a pointer that will point to a specific frequency; it will display it frequency value, and for the 3D perspective its intensity value;

	* you can play a test sound which is a sine wave from 1 to 20000 Hz;

	* you can set, in 'preferences' : 
		- the distance between frames : the biggest this value is, the 'deeper' the image will go;
		- the number of displayed frames, the biggest this value is, the 'deeper' the image will go and the more cpu will be used;
		- the interval of time (in milliseconds) between each refreshing of the display; the smallest this value will be, the nicer the display will look, but the more demanding it will be on the cpu; every change in this will require Spectrum3d to be restarted to be effective;
		- the color of the display (when analyse in real-time is selected);
		- whether you want the display in the same window as the GUI or in a separate window;
		- whether you want that the actual display is saved as preset;
		- the interval of time (in milliseconds) between each new analysis of the spectral data; as for display, the smallest this value will be, the more demanding it will be on the cpu; this value should match the interval of time between 2 displays for better display but this is not mandatory;
		- whether you want Spectrum3d to run in realtime mode (when JACK is not used); if so, you can choose between SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO policies, and set the priority; please see important note at the end of this file.

	All those preferences are kept in a 'preferences' file that is created at first use of Spectrum3d and placed in the home directory : ~/.spectrum3d/spectrum3d.pref. Everytime Spectrum3d starts, it check some values of this 'preferences' file for consistency; if out of range value is found, a new 'preferences' file with default values is created.

*********************
|  IMPORTANT NOTES  |
*********************

1. Although it is 3D with OpenGL, the drivers for 3D acceleration are not needed (no need for proprietary drivers here!), but it can help to have a better rendering. 

2. Spectrum 3D can use a lot of resources on your machine, given the real-time analysis and 3D display of the data's. 3 aspects are important : the power of the processor, the performance of the graphic card (with or without the 3D drivers) and the type of kernel that is being used (a preempt or real-time will allow better performance). The amount of needed resources is proportional to the width of the window. If your machine has difficulty, you can use a smaller window size (in Menu -> Edit -> Preferences), which decreases the needed resources.

3. RealTime mode will allow Spectrum3d to have priority on other running processes, in order to not be slowed down by them; it won't decrease the amount of CPU and GPU resources needed to perform the task. IMPORTANT WARNING : If you want to take advantage of this you should edit or create an '/etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf' file and put this inside : 

	@audio   -  rtprio     95
	
then you should add yourself as a member of the 'audio' group :

	- either go in System->Preferences->Users and Groups->Manage Groups, then select the 'audio' groups, click on 'Properties' and add yourself;
	- or by typing in a terminal : sudo adduser ${LOGNAME} audio 

then reboot.

If you don't do this, you'll have to run Spectrum3d as root, which is NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.
You'll find more information in the 'Realtime' file in the Doc directory.

4. Multitouch support is provided by the uTouch-geis API. For now, the whole screen receives fingers input for Spectrum3d while Spectrum3d is running (input is not limited to the Spectrum3d window), unless you use a version of uTouch-geis that is at least 2.1.0. On the other hand, when Sprectrum3d is running, the mouse pointer cannot be used from the touchpoint on the screen, but the mouse pointer is still driven by the mouse. This behavior could be the same in Natty or later, if you have a touchpad that supports multitouch : the touchpad only receives input as multitouch gestures, and you cannot use it anymore to drive the mouse as long as Spectrum 3d is running. 

You'll find more information in the 'Multitouch' file in the Doc directory.


Thank you for telling me whatever you want too and than you for your presence!
