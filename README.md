# What is Spectrum3d?

Spectrum 3D displays a 3D audio spectrogram in real time or not from the microphone or an audio file (including recorded file from the microphone); it is compatible with Jack (jack-audio-connection-kit). Optionally, it supports multitouch gestures from touchscreen and touchpad.

It is build with the Gstreamer, SDL (or Gtkglext), OpenGl, GTK+-2.0 and uTouch-Geis free libraries and is under GPL license. It is written for Ubuntu but works for other Linux distributions except for the multitouch frame (the uTouch suite is now available for Ubuntu).

Spectrum3d can be compiled against GTK2 or GTK3. SDL will be used as the OpenGL extension by default untill GtkGlExt has a stable release for GTK3 (however, GtkGlExt can be used already in Spectrum3d, including the development version (GTKGLEXT3 for GTK3), but this has to be specifically enabled at the time of compiling).
